# API Fixes Verification Guide - UPDATED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gemini API 404 Error ✅
**Problem**: The API was returning 404 error with message "models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found"
**Root Cause**: API key was being passed in URL query parameter instead of header
**Solution**: 
- Moved API key from URL query parameter to `x-goog-api-key` header
- Kept model name as `gemini-2.5-flash` (which is correct according to documentation)

### 2. ElevenLabs Audio Generation Failure ✅
**Problem**: Audio generation was failing with "No response audio generated" error
**Root Cause**: 
- ElevenLabs v3 model might not be available or audio tags were causing issues
- Complex audio tag format was not working reliably
**Solution**:
- Reverted to `eleven_multilingual_v2` model for stability
- Simplified audio tag format to work reliably with v2
- Removed complex SSML parsing requirements

### 3. Gemini Responses Too Short ✅
**Problem**: Gemini was giving very short, cryptic responses (under 50 words)
**Root Cause**: System prompt limited responses to under 50 words
**Solution**:
- Increased response length to 40-100 words for richer detail
- Enhanced system prompt for more atmospheric, detailed responses
- Increased maxOutputTokens from 150 to 250
- Improved fallback responses to be longer and more immersive

## How to Test

### Test Gemini API
1. Open the app at http://localhost:8081
2. Click "Show Debug" button
3. Click "Test Gemini API" button
4. Should see success message and response in console

### Test ElevenLabs Audio
1. Click "Test ElevenLabs" button
2. Should hear audio with mysterious voice
3. Check console for success messages

### Test Full Pipeline
1. Click the orb to start a case
2. Wait for story narration to complete
3. Ask a question using voice (e.g., "Who heard the screams?")
4. Should get longer, more detailed AI responses
5. Audio should play successfully with emotional variations

## Expected Behavior

### Gemini API
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Real AI responses instead of predefined fallbacks
- ✅ Longer, more detailed responses (40-100 words)
- ✅ Rich, atmospheric language with multiple layers of meaning
- ✅ Contextual answers based on case facts

### ElevenLabs Audio
- ✅ Reliable audio generation with v2 model
- ✅ Emotional voice variations (mysterious, dramatic, etc.)
- ✅ No more "No response audio generated" errors
- ✅ Consistent audio playback

## Debug Console Messages

Look for these success indicators:
```
[Gemini] ✅ SUCCESS! Generated response: ...
[ElevenLabs] Speech generated successfully: ... bytes
[Pipeline] ✅ Question processed - X questions remaining
```

## API Keys Used
- Gemini: `AIzaSyBjXIFOdJSWy1zYZDkKRF54WSHgCe_z0sQ`
- ElevenLabs: `sk_6e8b86dda4bccdb13ec004953383b48e86d7a7f852efaf8a`

Both APIs should now work reliably with proper authentication and stable model versions.
